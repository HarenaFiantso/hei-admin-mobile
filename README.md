HEI Admin is a student management platform (tracking tuition fees, monitoring students and professors, etc.) for the **Haute École d'Informatique Madagascar university.** Since I worked on this project a few months ago, I took the initiative to start this mobile project as I see it being more practical than the web version in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> **🐲 It is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use. 🏗️🚧**
